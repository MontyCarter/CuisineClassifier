-What problem did you work on? Why is it interesting?



-What are the important ideas you explored?



-What ideas from the class did you use?



-What did you learn?
	sparse matrix
	harder to classify 20 ways
	a single ingredient set can map to multiple cuisines
	observations about various ml algos
	decision tree @ 55%, using random forest and extremely random forest boost to high 70s


-Results (or for theoretical project, proofs)
	max is italian at 7838 rec, mex at 6438, french 2646, chin 2673, ind 3003, south_us 4320, rest at or below 1500
	many algos seem to converge at 55%, a couple seem to have upper bound at 77-78
	


-If you had much more time, how would you continue the project?
