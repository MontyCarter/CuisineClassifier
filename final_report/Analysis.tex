\section{Analysis}
The general lesson that we learned from this project is machine learning is not easy, specially for multi-class classification. Looking at the results shown in table 1, it is clear that we reached a limit on accuracy (around 80\%). Our guess for such limit is that multiple cuisines may share the same set of ingredients as mentioned in the previous section. For example, a large proportion of ingredients from Asian cuisines is the same. A direct implication of ingredient similarity among cuisines is that data set is not linearly separable. Even with feature transformation implemented by SVM with non-linear kernels, we were not be able to improve the performance of classifiers.

Moreover, we also learned that complexity of machine learning algorithms matters. One can see that runtime as well as accuracy of SVM algorithms is proportional to the complexity of their kernels. We would expect longer runtime if we increase the degree of polynomial kernels. Therefore, a trade-off between runtime (probably accuracy) and algorithm complexity can be explore. We also noticed resource limit is also an important factor to consider when we choose machine learning algorithms. We encountered out of memory exceptions when running
